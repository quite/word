For looking up words, I like to keep a dictd on localhost with a few of
databases installed. This is a lookup tool tailed to myself. It does automagic
paging.

By default, word talks to localhost:2628 and looks up the word, its first
argument, in these locally installed databases: gcide wn foldoc moby-thesaurus.

Stay local.
