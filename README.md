For looking up words, I like to keep an
[RFC2229](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2229) dictd answering on localhost
with a few of databases installed. This is a lookup tool so far tailored to
myself. Does automagic paging!

By default, word talks to localhost:2628 and looks up the word, its first
argument, in these locally installed databases: gcide wn foldoc moby-thesaurus.

Stay local.
